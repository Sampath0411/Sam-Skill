## What it does

Type `/sam` in Claude Code and it will:

- 🔀 **Git worktree setup** — Isolated workspace for safe fix testing
- 🔍 **Parallel file scanning** — Multiple agents scan different parts simultaneously
- 🐛 **Systematic bug detection** — Root cause investigation, not symptom fixes
- 🔎 **Research scout** — Hunts web/Reddit/HN for unknown bug solutions
- 🧪 **TDD fix application** — Every fix has a failing test first
- 👥 **Subagent-driven fixes** — Multi-agent workflow for complex bugs
- 🔒 **Security audit** — 40+ checks for vulnerabilities
- ⚡ **Performance audit** — Asset sizes, memory leaks, bundle bloat
- ♿ **Accessibility scan** — WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- 🔇 **Console noise removal** — Auto-removes console.log/debugger
- 💀 **Dead code elimination** — Unused imports, unreachable code
- 🗺️ **Graphify integration** — Deep knowledge graph with communities
- 🧠 **Memory consolidation** — Persists audit state across sessions
- 👁️ **Code review integration** — Request and receive reviews
- 🌐 **Webapp testing** — Playwright verification for web apps
- 📋 **SAM_AUDIT_REPORT.md** — Full audit report
- 🎯 **Human score** — 0-100 rating with specific deductions
- 🧩 **Finishing workflow** — Merge, PR, or cleanup options
- 🪨 **Caveman mode** — Ultra-compressed responses save tokens

## Install

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/sam
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sampath0411/Sam-Skill/main/SKILL.md \
  > ~/.claude/skills/sam/SKILL.md
```

Add to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```
- **sam** (`~/.claude/skills/sam/SKILL.md`) - Full project audit. Trigger: /sam
When the user types /sam, invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "sam"` before doing anything else.
```

---

## Command

```
/sam
```

That's it. One command. Does everything.

---

## Example output

```
/sam complete. 156 files scanned. 12 bugs. 23 warnings. 47 console lines removed.

CRITICAL:
- auth.js: token expiry check use < not <= → fixed with TDD
- api.js: missing await on fetchUser() → race condition fixed
- db.js: SQL injection risk → parameterized queries added

SECURITY:
- config.js: hardcoded API key → moved to env vars
- index.html: inline script → CSP nonce added

WARNINGS:
- utils.js: unused import 'lodash' → removed
- index.html: missing alt on 5 images → flagged

CONSOLE REMOVED: 47 lines across 12 files

GRAPH: api.js → auth, utils, components
Clusters: auth/, dashboard/, settings/
Dead ends: helpers.js, legacy.js
Surprising: utils.js connects auth and DB layers

HEALTH: 8/10 — good structure, needs error handling
HUMAN SCORE: 78/100 (-10 security, -5 unused imports, -7 missing tests)

NEXT:
1. Add try/catch to all async functions
2. Set up ESLint for automatic catches
3. Write tests for auth module
4. Archive legacy.js
5. Add loading states to fetch calls

Worktree → .worktrees/sam-audit

## The 15 Steps

| Step | What happens |
|------|--------------|
| 0 | Caveman mode activation |
| 1 | Git worktree setup (isolation) |
| 2 | Parallel file scanning |
| 3 | Systematic debugging (4-phase root cause) |
| 4 | Research scout (web/Reddit/HN) |
| 5 | TDD fix application (red-green-refactor) |
| 6 | Subagent-driven fixes |
| 7 | Comprehensive audit (bug/security/perf/a11y) |
| 8 | Webapp testing (Playwright) |
| 9 | Code review integration |
| 10 | Verification gates (20-point checklist) |
| 11 | Graphify integration (deep knowledge graph) |
| 12 | Memory consolidation |
| 13 | Report generation + human score |
| 14 | Production gate |
| 15 | Finishing workflow (merge/PR/cleanup) |

## Iron Laws

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST**

**NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT FAILING TEST FIRST**

**NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE**
